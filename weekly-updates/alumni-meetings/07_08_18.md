## Mentoring Styles

### Arpit

*What sort of meeting styles are you used to?*  

I'm used to a variety of different meeting styles.
- had 1 hour weekly meetings with an E-Board combined with biweekly 1 hour meetings with my committee
- weekly 1 hour meetings for work projects
- 15-minute daily scrum meetings

*What sort of meeting styles would you like to try out with your team when paired?*  

Flexible; depends on team and the project.
- Bi-weekly planning meeting
- 10-minute meeting with Project Lead every day or other day to review current progress if needed
- longer 30 minute to 1 hour meetings per week with full project team
- additional meetings can be based on the need for any given week
- can work out actual meeting schedule and meeting style with the project lead based on whatever is more helpful

### Carlin

*What sort of meeting styles are you used to?*  
I'd like 1hr weekly sync up meetings where we talk about what was accomplished, any blockers and how to move past them, and what we want to work on next. Maybe a biweekly planning meeting to determine long term roadmap. I'm flexible if the team doesn't feel weekly is necessary or if they would rather try something else.

*What sort of meeting styles would you like to try out with your team when paired?*  
I'm open to different styles, I can set aside 1-3 hours a week to help out. The team can figure out how they would like to use that time as long as I'm available at the times requested. What I put in the last question is how I've suggested my time be spent.

*What frameworks/tools/programming languges have you used/are comfortable with?*  
Node.js, React, Python, a bunch of CI/CD tools like docker, Jenkins, ansible

### Constantina

*What sort of meeting styles are you used to?*

-Used to weekly, 1-hour "staff" meetings where the lead will share updates across all work related to team, and where people have a chance to bring up whatever they want to bring up

-Have had previous experience where teams will have scrum meetings/daily standups where people will just update the team on what they did, what they are planning to do, and what issues they are facing

-1-on-1's

-Retrospective meetings--kinda like how we did post-moterm, but these meetings are more frequent because they happen at the end of a sprint in agile software development

-Planning meetings--same vein a s retrospective except they happen at the beginning of a sprint, and used to delegate tasks to teammembers

*What sort of meeting styles would you like to try out with your team when paired?*

It really depends on the project and who the team lead is. Also, what the general skill level/vibe of the team. Daily standups/scrums will not be possible for me due to the time difference, and I'm pretty sure would still be difficult given that everyone's schedules are different. For the purpose of mentorship, I'd love to do 1-on-1's, but at the very minimum, I would like a meeting with either the team lead or the majority of the team so that they have a chance to pick my brain and I can give feedback to the larger group.

*What frameworks/tools/programming languges have you used/are comfortable with?*

-HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, React, Selenium), Python (Flask, pyATS), Java (Selenium, RestAssured -- which I would need to brush up on), SQL, C, Eclipse, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

### Sakib

*What sort of meeting styles are you used to?*
- weekly meetings to discuss what everyone did during the week to identify blockers and update objectives, both on video calls and in-person

*What sort of meeting styles would you like to try out with your team when paired?*
- depends on what the young ones are comfortable with. weekly is cool, down to do 1-on-1s with people who request it
